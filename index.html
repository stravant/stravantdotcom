                <h4>About me</h4>
                <p>I'm Mark Langen, a professional programmer living in Edmonton, Alberta who goes by the handle <i>"stravant"</i> online. 
                I have experience focused in the following areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java / Android App Development &mdash; I have developed multiple Android applications professionally,
                        as well as some others as hobby projects. I have also worked on large enterprise scale
                        Java codebases outside of the Android ecosystem including Swing and JavaFX desktop applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>Low Level C/C++ Programming &mdash; I have done a lot of low-level work with C++, including writing multiple
                        libraries for reading and manipulating binary file formats, writing parsers and compilers, and writing code
                        for embedded systems. I know C++ throroughly enough to do everything from writing stable enterprise
                        code to using crazy template metaprogramming tricks.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lua Scripting and Lua C API Development &mdash; I have a very in-depth knowledge of the Lua scripting language,
                        including developing C/C++ API bindings for it as well as details of the language's history and implementation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Other interests:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Programming Language Geek &mdash; I've written some code in, or at least done some reading on pretty much
                        every reasonably popular programming language under the sun. I can pick up any programming language pretty 
                        quickly whether it be an everyday OO/proceedural language, an array based language, or even something more 
                        exotic like a logic based language.
                    </li>
                    <li>Getting my Hands Dirty in a Hex Dump &mdash; I have a good understaning of low level programming in 
                        assembly code and reverse engineering compiled code / binary file formats, as
                        well as low level operating system concepts, having done some bare-metal programming.
                    </li>
                </ul>
